synopsis: "A modular parametricity plugin for proof transfer in Coq"
description: """
Trocq is a modular parametricity plugin for Coq. It can be used to
achieve proof transfer by both translating a user goal into another,
related, variant, and computing a proof that proves the corresponding implication.

The plugin features a hierarchy of structures on relations, whose
instances are computed from registered user-defined proof via
parametricity. This hierarchy ranges from structure-less relations
to an original formulation of type equivalence. The resulting
framework generalizes [raw
parametricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6336), [univalent
parametricity](https://doi.org/10.1145/3429979) and
[CoqEAL](https://github.com/coq-community/coqeal), and includes them
in a unified framework.

The plugin computes a parametricity translation "Ã  la carte", by
performing a fine-grained analysis of the requires properties for a
given proof of relatedness. In particular, it is able to prove
implications without resorting to full-blown type equivalence,
allowing this way to perform proof transfer without necessarily
pulling in the univalence axiom.

The plugin is implemented in Coq-Elpi and the code of the
parametricity translation is fairly close to a pen-and-paper
sequent-style presentation."""
